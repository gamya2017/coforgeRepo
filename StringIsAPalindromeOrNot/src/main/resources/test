Ans:  
we first reverse the string or number and compare the reversed string or number with the original value are equal,
 then the linked list is palindrome; otherwise, not.        
 
                                   Or 
To check if a linked list is palindrome or not, we need to compare the first element with the last element, 
the second element with the second last element, the third element with the third last element, etc. 
If all the comparisons are equal, then the linked list is palindrome; otherwise, not.
